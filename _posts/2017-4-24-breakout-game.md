## Today I learned (#TIL):

- The outline of Canvas element. 

I use HTML5 everyday, but not so familiar with canvas.
I think it's because I haven't handled JS.
Many browsers can't render them though, it's very interesting.
(Only five years ago, I used to make swapping navigation tabs one by one with JPEG!!!
Now they are very easy to edit with CSS3.)
