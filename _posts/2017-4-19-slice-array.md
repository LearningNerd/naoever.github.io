title: 4-19-2017 Vertual meeting 2 Array introduction, Slice function
---

## at Vertual Meeting 2

- Pair programming (ongoing, I'll keep on)
https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence

- Array introduction (I used the similar idea on week 1 challenge 2)
https://naoever.github.io/challenge-2-returns/

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- to split
- to slice
- litte more about array
- coherence of "" '' for strings.

## Useful links to save for later:

To learn to split.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split

## My next goals:

- Finish Freecode camp's "Title Case a Sentence"
- Get to know and use Slice () (homework)
- Get to know and use toUpperCase()

Don't copy & paste, make it from scratch to practice, practice, practice.
