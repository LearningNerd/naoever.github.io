## Today I learned: Steps for making a blog post with git: 

- Make a new file inside _/posts

- Must have format: 2017-4-9-title-here.md

- Copy content from previous blog post, paste it in.

- Update title and content for today.

- Inside command line, navigate to your project folder

- git status
- git add .
- git status
- git commit -m "My short message here"
- git push
