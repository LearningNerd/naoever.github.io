title: 4-20-2017 Slice
---

## Today I learned (#TIL):

- Learn how slice() works and found that it can be used for TitleCase challenge.
https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence

```javascript
var str = "i'm a little tea cup.";
var str2 = str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
console.log(str2);
```

This can print out the very first letter of the ENTIRE STRING Uppercase.
I think I need to apply Split which we learned on the meeting to make every first letters uppercase.
